# Machine Learning Project with Django

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning (ML) models into a Django-based web application. It showcases how to create, deploy, and manage machine learning models using Django's backend framework. The project provides an API for interacting with the ML models, making it easier for developers to use the trained models for predictions.

## Features
- **ML Model Integration**: The project integrates a pre-trained machine learning model into the Django app.
- **API Endpoints**: Exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the model for making predictions.
- **Pagination**: The results from model predictions can be paginated to manage large datasets efficiently.
- **Filtering and Searching**: Allows filtering and searching results based on input parameters to enhance the querying experience.
- **Customizable**: The project allows easy updates and improvements to the ML model, API, and other configurations.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Required Python libraries for ML (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-django-project.git
   cd ml-django-project

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver
python manage.py runserver

Using the Application
Once the server is up and running, you can access the application and interact with the ML model via the API endpoints.

To make predictions, navigate to the relevant endpoint (e.g., /predict/).
To view data, access the /data/ endpoint, which will provide model results.
Model Training
This project is designed to be easily extendable to integrate any ML model. You can train a new model using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, and save the model using joblib or pickle for use in this application.

Example:
Train the model using your preferred method.
Save the trained model (e.g., model.pkl).
Load the model in Django using Python's joblib or pickle.
